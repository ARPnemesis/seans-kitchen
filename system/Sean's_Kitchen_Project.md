# Sean's Kitchen — Project Master Reference
*Royal Kitchen Automation System · Established June 2026 · Updated 2026-06-19*

---

## What This Is

A fully automated weekly meal-planning system. Every Friday a pipeline of scheduled tasks builds a brand-new 5-dinner menu, writes recipe files and a shopping list, schedules dinners on the calendar with recipe links, and refreshes a live dashboard — all informed by Sean's taste ratings and evolving preferences. **Canonical data lives in `E:\Seans_Royal_Kitchen\`.**

## The Team (8 scheduled tasks)

| Employee | Task ID | Schedule | Role |
|----------|---------|----------|------|
| 👑 Kitchen Manager | `the-manager` | Daily 7 AM | Health check on all tasks; verifies the ledger; escalates failures; approves mid-tier changes. |
| 🔧 Developer | `kitchen-developer` | 1st Fri 6 AM | Monthly system review; auto-fixes minor issues; proposes major ones. |
| 📋 Critic | `meal-critic-weekly` | Fri 8 AM | Reads ratings, updates taste profile, writes Lessons Learned for the Chef. |
| 🗄️ Archivist | `kitchen-archivist` | Fri 4:30 PM | Files the just-finished (PREVIOUS) week into Archive\; resets the rating form. |
| 🍳 Chef | `weekly-kings-menu` | Fri 5 PM | Builds a fresh 5-dish menu, recipes, shopping list; refreshes dashboard; updates the week ledger. |
| 📅 Scheduler | `kitchen-scheduler` | Fri 5:30 PM | Puts the ACTIVE week's dishes on the calendar with recipe links. |
| 📝 Scribe | `kitchen-scribe` | Fri 5:45 PM | Backs up the kitchen to GitHub via the Windows host PowerShell task; refreshes README. |
| 📬 Surveyor | `meal-surveyor` | Sun 7 PM | Refreshes the Rate This Week app with the PREVIOUS week's dishes; emails a Monday 9 AM rating reminder. |

Task prompts (SKILL.md) live at `C:\Users\seanm\OneDrive\Documents\Claude\Scheduled\<id>\`. A backup of all 8 is at `System\Recovered_Task_Prompts_2026-06-10.md`.

## Source of Truth: `System\Current_Week.md`

Every task reads this ledger to know which week it operates on — never inferred from "the most recent menu file" (that caused off-cycle drift).

- **ACTIVE_WEEK** = the week currently being cooked (Chef most recently built). Scheduler + dashboard use it.
- **PREVIOUS_WEEK** = the week most recently finished. Surveyor rates it, Critic processes it, Archivist files it.

Each Friday the Chef builds a fresh ACTIVE week. Normal week: old ACTIVE rolls to PREVIOUS. Re-run for the same week: the Chef rebuilds in place and leaves PREVIOUS untouched.

## No Carryover

Removed June 2026. Every week is 5 brand-new dishes; the Chef never repeats a dish served in the last 3 weeks (only exception: a Critic-recommended 4–5★ favorite absent 4+ weeks). Sean does not maintain any carry-forward list.

## Ingredient Policy: assume nothing

The Chef assumes Sean owns nothing and lists/cart-adds every ingredient (incl. salt, pepper, oil). Sean trims what he owns in the **Inventory app**.

## Live Artifacts (3)

| Artifact id | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `kings-table-kitchen-dashboard` | Menu, macro scoreboard, "Generate menu" (→ runScheduledTask), "Build Instacart cart" (King Soopers; subtracts inventory), links to the other two apps. |
| `kings-table-rate-this-week` | Weekly rating. Submit writes a `Rate_Submission_<date>` doc to the Cookbook folder on Google Drive. |
| `kings-table-inventory` | What Sean owns. Save writes a `Kitchen_Inventory` doc to Google Drive. |

**Why Drive?** Persisted artifacts can't write local files and have no `sendPrompt`. So they bridge through Google Drive: the **rating** app → `Rate_Submission_*` (the Critic reads it Friday and writes `Rate_This_Week.md`); the **inventory** app → `Kitchen_Inventory` (the dashboard cart reads it at build time). Drive `create_file` only creates, so readers take the newest copy by createdTime.

## Rating Flow

```
Sun 7 PM   → Surveyor refreshes Rate This Week app (PREVIOUS week's dishes) + Monday 9 AM email reminder
Mon–Fri    → Sean rates in the app → Submit → Rate_Submission_<date> saved to Google Drive
Fri 8 AM   → Critic pulls latest Rate_Submission from Drive → Rate_This_Week.md → Recipe_Ratings.md + Preferences + Lessons Learned
```

Rate_This_Week.md                               ← rating form (Critic fills Fri, Archivist blanks after)
README.md, How_This_Kitchen_Works.md            ← docs (Scribe / manual)
Recipes\                                         ← permanent recipe library

  Kitchen_Log.md             ← shared briefing board (all tasks read + append)
  Kitchen_Manager_Charter.md, Preferences.md, Recipe_Ratings.md, Weekly_Staples.md
  Sean's_Kitchen_Project.md  ← this file
  Recovered_Task_Prompts_*.md ← backup of all 8 task prompts
  Developer_Report_*.md, Change_Requests\, Kitchen_Log_Archive\
  *.ps1, *.vbs, *.pem, ntfy_topic.txt ← Windows host scripts + secrets (gitignored)
```

## Notifications & Sync

- **Phone alerts:** tasks append to `System\.ntfy_queue.json`; a Windows PowerShell flusher pushes to ntfy.
- **GitHub backup:** the Scribe writes a commit-trigger; the Windows `github_sync.ps1` task pushes `E:\Seans_Royal_Kitchen\` to GitHub (the Cowork sandbox has no outbound network, so git runs on the host). Secrets (`.pem`, ntfy topic, tokens, setup scripts) are gitignored.
