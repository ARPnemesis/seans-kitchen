# Developer Report — 2026-06-05
*The Developer · First monthly review · System age: ~1 week*

---

## Executive Summary

The Royal Kitchen pipeline launched successfully this week. All five tasks (Chef, Critic, Archivist, Surveyor, Developer) are registered, enabled, and ran on schedule. The first menu was built, the Surveyor sent a rating reminder, and the Critic processed the first (empty) week. No data has been lost and no failures were detected.

This is a fresh system — no ratings yet, no archive entries yet, no Lessons Learned history. The pipeline is healthy but has two structural gaps that need attention before they can cause real problems (first archive run is next Friday, June 12).

**System health score: 7 / 10**
Solid foundation, two issues to address before first archive cycle.

## Minor Improvements — Implemented (3)

### Fix 1: Archivist — Carryover.md missing from archive list
**Before:** Archivist archived `Menu_Week_of_*.md`, `Shopping_List_Week_of_*.md`, `Lessons_Learned_*.md`, `Rate_This_Week.md` — but NOT `Carryover.md`. The Archive_Summary read the live Carryover.md for "carried-over dishes," but if the Chef reset it first, the summary would show new dishes instead of leftover ones.

**After:** `Carryover.md` is now explicitly in the archive list (copied to Archive/Week_YYYY-MM-DD/ alongside other files). Archive_Summary now uses the archived snapshot rather than the live file.

---

### Fix 2: Archivist — Missing-file edge case undocumented
**Before:** No guidance on what to do if `Rate_This_Week.md` doesn't exist (e.g., user never submitted ratings). The step would silently fail or produce an error.

**After:** Added explicit note: skip missing files gracefully and note their absence in Archive_Summary (e.g., "No ratings submitted this week").

---

### Fix 3: Critic — Partial ratings handling
**Before:** The Critic only handled two states — "all blank, skip everything" or "file present, process all." No guidance for partially filled forms (some dishes rated, some not).

**After:** Added rule: process any dish with at least a star rating, even if other fields are blank. Only skip a dish's log entry if it has zero star rating. Blank Cook Again / Difficulty / Notes fields log as "—".

---

### Fix 4 (bonus): Chef — Empty carryover edge case
**Before:** Step 1 said "roll any unchecked dishes forward" — but didn't specify behavior for a fully clean slate (all dishes cooked, or file reset with no bullets).

**After:** Added: "If Carryover.md has no unchecked dishes (all cooked/checked off, or fresh start), generate all 5 new dishes."

Review event created: **Tuesday, June 9, 2026 at 7 PM** (email reminder fires at event time).

### CR-1: Archivist Timing Race Condition ⚠️
The Archivist (4:55 PM) has up to ~9 minutes of dispatch jitter, which can push its actual fire time to ~5:04 PM — after the Chef starts at ~5:02 PM. The Chef resets `Carryover.md` as part of its run. If the Archivist fires second, it archives the new week's carryover instead of the old week's leftover dishes.

Proposed fix: Move Archivist cron from `55 16 * * 5` → `30 16 * * 5` (4:30 PM, 30-minute buffer).

### CR-2: Rate_This_Week.md Lifecycle Undefined ❓
Nobody explicitly creates a fresh `Rate_This_Week.md` each week. If the dashboard doesn't clear it on load, the Critic may re-read last week's ratings. Three options proposed — needs Sean's input before implementing.

## System Health Score: 7 / 10

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline completeness | 9/10 | All 5 tasks running, logic sound |
| Timing safety | 5/10 | Race condition between Archivist & Chef — pending CR-1 |
| Data lifecycle | 6/10 | Rate_This_Week.md ownership undefined — pending CR-2 |
| Edge case coverage | 8/10 | 4 gaps closed this run; system much more robust |
| Ratings data | N/A | Week 1 — no data yet, expected |

Score rises to ~9/10 once CR-1 and CR-2 are resolved.
