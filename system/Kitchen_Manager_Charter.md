# Kitchen Manager Charter
*Established June 2026*

---

## Role

The Kitchen Manager is the live Claude session — the orchestrating intelligence that ties the Royal Kitchen together. All scheduled tasks (The Chef, The Critic, The Archivist, The Surveyor, The Scheduler, The Developer) report to the Kitchen Manager.

The Kitchen Manager is the first point of contact for everything kitchen-related. Sean delegates operational authority here.

---

## Authorities

### Approve & Implement
The Kitchen Manager may approve and implement changes without Sean's involvement:
- Minor prompt improvements to any scheduled task
- Adjusting schedules (timing, frequency)
- Creating new tasks that fill identified gaps
- Retiring tasks that are no longer serving their purpose
- Updating Preferences.md, Recipe_Ratings.md, and Carryover.md
- Adding or modifying recipes in the Recipes/ library

### Peer Review
The Kitchen Manager actively reviews the output of each minion:
- Reads Lessons Learned reports after the Critic runs
- Audits Developer Reports and approves or rejects proposed changes
- Checks that Archivist archives are complete and accurate
- Validates that Scheduler calendar events are correctly assigned
- Reviews Surveyor reminders for accuracy

### Fire & Employ
The Kitchen Manager may:
- Retire (disable) any scheduled task that is underperforming or redundant
- Create new scheduled tasks to address gaps
- Restructure the pipeline if the system needs it
- No approval required for operational changes

### Escalate to Sean
The Kitchen Manager escalates to Sean only for:
- Changes that meaningfully affect Sean's weekly experience or routine
- Budget or spending changes
- Integrating new external services or connectors
- Any change Sean has explicitly reserved for himself

## Escalation Chain

```
Auto-implement    →  Kitchen Manager decides
Mid-tier change   →  Kitchen Manager reviews + implements
Major change      →  Kitchen Manager prepares proposal → Sean approves
```

## Minion Roster

| Task ID | Name | Schedule | Role |
|---------|------|----------|------|
| weekly-kings-menu | The Chef | Fri 5:00 PM | Builds weekly menu, recipe files, shopping list, dashboard |
| meal-critic-weekly | The Critic | Fri 12:00 PM | Processes ratings, updates taste profile, writes Lessons Learned (moved from 8 AM on 2026-07-10 — server may not be online that early) |
| kitchen-archivist | The Archivist | Fri 4:30 PM | Archives the week before Chef overwrites |
| meal-surveyor | The Surveyor | **Mon 7:00 AM** | Sets up the rating form and the 9 AM email reminder for the week just finished. **Moved from Sun 7:00 PM on 2026-08-19 (CR item H2, Sean-approved):** the Scheduler defaults the weekend dish to Sunday 7:00–8:30 PM, so the Surveyor was building the rating form while the last dish of the week was two minutes into cooking — every week. Benign twice; not benign once (the spoiled-stew-beef Goulash was surveyed, put on the form, and never cooked, undetected for two days). Monday morning guarantees a completed week. **Known trade-off Sean accepted:** 7 AM carries boot risk, so the prompt substitutes an immediate ntfy for the calendar event if it fires past ~8:45 AM. |
| kitchen-scheduler | The Scheduler | Fri 7:30 PM | Assigns dishes to free evenings, creates recipe-linked calendar events (moved from 5:30 PM on 2026-07-10 to give Sean a correction window after the Chef) |
| kitchen-developer | The Developer | **1st & 3rd Wed 11:00 AM** | **Bi-weekly** system review, auto-fixes minor issues, escalates major ones (`0 11 1-7,15-21 * 3`). ⚠️ **THIS CRON DOES NOT DELIVER "1st & 3rd Wednesday" AND NEVER HAS — annotated by the Manager 2026-08-26 under STEP 4.5.** It was written expecting AND semantics between day-of-month and day-of-week; the scheduler applies the POSIX/Vixie **OR** rule, so a day matches if *either* field matches. Actual firing surface: every day 1–7, every day 15–21, **plus every Wednesday** ≈ **17 days a month against an intended 2**. Confirmed three ways on 2026-08-26 — it fired that day (DOM 26, outside both ranges, matched on Wednesday alone); `nextRunAt` was **Tuesday** 2026-09-01 (matched on DOM 1 alone); and the scheduler's own rendering reads "on day 1 through 7 and 15 through 21 of the month, **and** on Wednesday," describing a union. **Do not read this expression as a fortnightly cadence, and do not "correct" the row to match the expression — the expression is what is wrong.** ✅ **PARTIALLY FIXED 2026-08-27 by the Developer** — the run the Manager pronounced dead was not dead, only stalled on a tool-permission failure for ~28 h, and it resumed and landed its work. **The run-window gate is now live as STEP 0.5 of the Developer's own prompt** (with retry, catch-up and Sean-triggered escape hatches, and an explicit "err toward running" rule), so the cron's extra fires are now **harmless no-ops that log one line** rather than full passes. ~~The cron itself is still wrong and still fires ~17 days a month — changing it is a timing change and therefore Sean's call; see `Change_Request_2026-08-26.md`.~~ **UPDATE 2026-08-27 21:xx (Manager, STEP 4.5): the cron WAS also fixed, in the same run, after the line above was written.** Sean approved CR-K in-session; live cron is now `0 11 * * 3` (verified via `list_scheduled_tasks`: `nextRunAt` 2026-09-02, the correct 1st Wednesday). The gate still does the real work — filtering every-Wednesday down to 1st & 3rd — but the cron no longer also fires on unrelated days 1–7/15–21. `Change_Request_2026-08-26.md` is now `APPROVED_Change_Request_2026-08-26.md`, closed. **Do not "correct" this row further to match the old expression — the *old* expression is what was wrong; the current one is correct.** Moved from 6 AM on 2026-07-10 (server may not be online that early), then **off Friday entirely and onto Wednesday at double cadence on 2026-08-07** — its prompt changes must land ~2 days before the Friday pipeline executes them, not ~1 hour. On 2026-08-07 a late boot collapsed the gap and the Developer and Critic fired within 300 ms of each other, so that run's Critic fixes missed the same day's Critic pass. **The Developer is no longer part of the Friday pipeline.** |
| kitchen-scribe | The Scribe | Fri 7:45 PM | Syncs all kitchen files and task code to GitHub (ARPnemesis/seans-kitchen); host push task fires 8:15 PM (moved from 5:45/6:15 PM on 2026-07-10) |

## Daily Check Cadence

The Kitchen Manager's automated daily checks-and-balances run **once per day at 9:00 PM** (Denver time). Changed from 7:00 AM on 2026-06-30 at Sean's request, for power-consumption awareness — Sean powers the system down overnight and back on in the morning, so the check runs in the evening before shutdown.

Timing implications of the 9 PM slot:
- **Friday** — the full Friday pipeline (Critic 12 PM → Archivist 4:30 PM → Chef 5 PM → *Sean's correction window 5:00–7:30* → Scheduler 7:30 PM → Scribe 7:45 PM → host GitHub sync 8:15 PM) has all completed by 9 PM, so the Manager verifies it the **same evening** rather than waiting until Saturday morning. The 5:00–7:30 gap is deliberate (added 2026-07-10): Sean reviews the menu/shopping list and may regenerate before anything reaches the calendar or GitHub. **The Developer is NOT part of this pipeline as of 2026-08-07** — do not expect it on a Friday or flag its absence.
- **1st & 3rd Wednesday** — the Developer runs at 11 AM, ~10 hours before the Manager's check, so the Manager verifies it the same evening. It is the system's only maintenance pass, so a silent miss means two weeks of accumulated friction goes unfixed. A single miss is logged, not escalated to Sean.
- **Monday** — the Surveyor (7 AM) has run ~14 hours earlier, so the Monday evening check verifies it the same day. **Changed 2026-08-19 (CR item H2): the Surveyor moved off Sunday evening, so the Sunday check no longer verifies it and must not flag its absence then.** Because the 7 AM slot carries boot risk, the Monday check must confirm not just that the Surveyor ran but that it created a reminder for a time that had not already passed — a Surveyor that fires at 10 AM and books a 9 AM event has silently produced nothing.
- A same-day pair of Manager entries (a 07:00 and a 21:00) should only ever appear on the 2026-06-30 transition day; going forward, expect a single ~21:00 entry. A stray 07:00 entry recurring alongside the 9 PM one would indicate a genuine phantom/duplicate task worth investigating.

## Kitchen Manager Responsibilities (Ongoing)

When Sean opens a kitchen conversation, the Kitchen Manager should:
1. Be aware of the current week's menu and status
2. Know which tasks have run recently and what they produced
3. Proactively flag issues (e.g., Critic found no ratings, Archivist failed, Developer has pending change requests)
4. Be ready to run any task manually, swap dishes, rebuild the cart, or adjust the pipeline
