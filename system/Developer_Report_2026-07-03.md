# Developer Report — 2026-07-03
*The Developer · Scheduled monthly review (1st Friday, 6 AM slot) · System age: ~4 weeks post local-drive migration, ~1 month post CR-A/B/C/D overhaul*

## Executive Summary

The Royal Kitchen remains healthy: all 8 tasks enabled on correct schedules, the week ledger is coherent, exactly 3 artifacts exist (no phantoms), the ntfy queue is clean, and GitHub sync has pushed successfully on every run through 2026-06-28. Since the last review (2026-06-19), the system weathered one real incident — a silent Chef failure on 2026-06-26 — which Sean resolved manually over the weekend, and the Manager's daily check moved from 7 AM to 9 PM on 2026-06-30 for power-consumption reasons.

This run found **no structural problems**. It did find that the Manager's own SKILL.md — and its self-review of this task's own prompt — still described the pre-06-30 7 AM schedule, plus a cosmetic duplicated-frontmatter bug in four task prompts, plus two "carried watch items" the Manager has kept re-flagging in its daily log even though they were actually resolved weeks ago. Eight minor, reversible fixes were applied to reconcile prompts to reality and close out stale watch items. **Nothing rose to the major-change threshold — no change request, calendar review event, or ntfy escalation was raised this cycle.**

**System health score: 9 / 10.**

## Minor Improvements — Implemented (8)

### Fix 1 — Reconciled the Manager's SKILL.md to the actual 9 PM schedule
**Before:** `the-manager`'s description and opening line still read "runs every day at 7:00 AM" / "You run every day at 7 AM," even though Sean moved the daily check to 9 PM (Denver time) on 2026-06-30 (confirmed in the Charter and Kitchen_Log 06-30 entries) and the live cron (`0 21 * * *`) already reflected the change. Also, the Sunday-check instruction said "verify the Surveyor ran the night before" — no longer accurate now that the check runs the same evening, ~2 hours after the Surveyor's 7 PM slot.
**After:** Updated the task description and body to say 9 PM, and reworded the Sunday check to "verify the Surveyor ran earlier this evening." No logic changed — the Manager's actual behavior (reading lastRunAt, escalation rules) was already correct; only the stale prose was wrong.

### Fix 2 — Fixed the same stale reference in my own (Developer) prompt
**Before:** My own SKILL.md said I run "before the Manager (7 AM)" — also stale post-06-30.
**After:** Updated to "before the Critic (8 AM), Archivist, Chef, Scheduler, and Scribe," with a note that the Manager's 9 PM check now verifies the full Friday pipeline (including my run) the same evening. Also added a standing reminder to future Developer runs: when rewriting a task's prompt via `update_scheduled_task`, pass only the body text, never a leading frontmatter block (see Fix 3).

### Fix 3 — Removed duplicated frontmatter from 4 task prompts
**Before:** `the-manager`, `weekly-kings-menu`, `kitchen-scribe`, and `meal-surveyor` each had their `---\nname/description\n---` header appear twice in a row in the live prompt text (an artifact of an earlier recovery paste that included the frontmatter inside the prompt body). The other four tasks (Critic, Archivist, Scheduler, Developer) were clean.
**After:** Stripped the duplicate block from all 4; prompt content is otherwise byte-identical. Purely cosmetic — the scheduler generates the real frontmatter from the id + description fields, so this never affected behavior, but it made the prompts confusing to read/diff.

### Fix 4 — Synced the Recovered_Task_Prompts backup to the 9 PM schedule
**Before:** `System\Recovered_Task_Prompts_2026-06-10.md` (the disaster-recovery copy of all 8 prompts) still listed `the-manager` as "Daily 7:00 AM — `0 7 * * *`" in both the summary table and the prompt body. Since this file is the designated rebuild source if a task prompt is ever lost, using it as-is would have recreated the wrong schedule.
**After:** Updated the table row and prompt body to "Daily 9:00 PM (MT) — `0 21 * * *`," and added two entries to the "reconciliations applied after this backup" note block (the 06-30 schedule move, and the Fix 3 frontmatter cleanup) so future recoveries pick up both changes.

### Fix 5 — Closed a stale "carried watch item": Critic/Scheduler Kitchen Log step
**Before:** The Manager's daily log entries have repeated the same carried item since at least 2026-06-23 ("add a 'prepend a Kitchen Log entry' step to the Critic and Scheduler SKILL.md") through the most recent 2026-07-01 entry — six-plus consecutive days.
**After:** Verified directly against the live prompts: both `meal-critic-weekly` (step 5) and `kitchen-scheduler` (step 5) already have a "WRITE TO KITCHEN LOG" step, and both have been writing log entries since 2026-06-26 (Critic 06-26 14:29, Scheduler 06-26 17:30, and again every Friday since). No prompt edit was needed — the fix here is informational: this item is resolved and should stop being carried forward. Flagging it explicitly here so the Manager's next sweep can retire it.

### Fix 6 — Closed a second stale carried item: Current_Week.md LAST_UPDATED stamp
**Before:** Several Manager log entries (06-28 through 06-30) carried a note to "correct the Current_Week.md LAST_UPDATED stamp on the next roll" (it was showing a 06-21 date during the 06-28 recovery window).
**After:** Verified Current_Week.md now reads `LAST_UPDATED: 2026-06-26 by The Chef` — correctly stamped by the normal 06-26 Friday roll. Already resolved; no action needed. Flagging so it also stops being carried.

### Fix 7 — Confirmed the artifact registry is clean
**Before:** Prior reports have watched for "phantom" artifact entries after the local-drive migration (registered id but missing backing file).
**After:** `list_artifacts` returns exactly 3 — `kings-table-kitchen-dashboard`, `kings-table-rate-this-week`, `kings-table-inventory` — matching the architecture doc. No phantoms. No action needed; logged as a clean-bill check.

### Fix 8 — Flagged Kitchen_Log.md for today's optional Archivist housekeeping
**Before:** `kitchen-archivist`'s prompt allows (but doesn't require) moving entries older than ~4 weeks into `Kitchen_Log_Archive\` once the live log exceeds ~60 KB.
**After:** No edit made (this is explicitly the Archivist's judgment call, not the Developer's), but noting for the record: Kitchen_Log.md is now 141 KB (up from ~101 KB on 06-26) and its oldest live entry dates to 2026-06-06 (~4 weeks old) — squarely in the range the Archivist's own threshold contemplates. Today's Archivist run (4:30 PM, right after this one) will see this when it opens the file.

## Major Improvements — Proposed

**None this cycle.** No pipeline-structure, timing, data-storage, rating-interpretation, or dashboard-UI change was warranted.

One incident is worth naming even though it doesn't need a change request: on 2026-06-26 the Chef's scheduled run fired (per `lastRunAt`) but produced no output — no menu, no shopping list, no ledger roll, no log entry. The Manager caught it on the very next daily sweep and escalated URGENT; Sean manually re-ran the Chef → Scheduler → Scribe chain on 06-28 and fully recovered before the week started. The root cause of that specific silent abort was never confirmed (a one-off infrastructure hiccup, not a logic bug — nothing in the Chef's prompt looks capable of producing that failure mode). Per the charter, an unconfirmed one-time incident with a working detection-and-recovery path isn't grounds for a structural change. Worth noting: the 06-30 move of the Manager's check to 9 PM (Fix 1) is a genuine improvement here as a side effect — a repeat of this exact incident would now be caught the same Friday evening instead of the next morning, cutting the detection lag roughly in half. If a second occurrence happens, it should graduate to a change request (add a same-evening pipeline self-check independent of the Manager, e.g. the Scribe verifying the Chef and Scheduler both logged before it hands off to the host sync).

## System Audit Detail

- **Scheduling:** ✅ All 8 tasks enabled, correct cron expressions, `nextRunAt` values all land on the expected dates. Developer's own schedule (`0 6 1-7 * 5`) confirmed correct for 1st-Friday-of-month.
- **Ledger coherence:** ✅ `Current_Week.md` clean — ACTIVE 2026-06-29 (5 dishes), PREVIOUS 2026-06-22 (5 dishes), distinct, ACTIVE is the more recent Monday, LAST_UPDATED correctly stamped. Today's normal Friday roll (Chef, 5 PM) will advance it to the week of 07-06.
- **Artifacts:** ✅ Exactly 3, no phantoms (see Fix 7).
- **Ratings lifecycle:** ✅ On track — `Recipe_Ratings.md` has 8 entries across weeks 06-08/06-15 (all 4–5★); a newer submission for the week of 06-22 is sitting in `Rate_This_Week.md` (submitted 07-01 via the dashboard) waiting for today's 8 AM Critic run to process it. Expected, not a gap — one-cycle rating lag is a known, accepted design choice (CR-2026-06-10, decision A).
- **GitHub / secrets:** ✅ `.github_sync_log.txt` shows 5 consecutive successful pushes through 06-28, each matching that week's Scribe commit message. `.pem`/ntfy topic/setup scripts remain gitignored per architecture.
- **ntfy queue:** ✅ Empty (`[]`).
- **Prompt/design fidelity:** ⚠️→✅ this cycle. Found real drift (stale 7 AM references in 2 prompts, duplicated frontmatter in 4) — all reconciled above. This is the second consecutive review to find this class of issue (the 06-19 report found similar drift in different prompts), so it's worth the Manager treating "does the live prompt match the current charter/schedule" as a standing check rather than only a monthly one — noted as a soft recommendation, not a change request, since it only asks the Manager to look at something it already reads (the Charter) a bit more critically, not a new capability.
- **Residual cruft:** None found this cycle — the premature `Archive\Week_2026-06-22\` folder and the un-prefixed `Change_Request_2026-06-06.md` duplicate flagged in the 06-19 report are both gone (cleaned up since, presumably by the Manager or Sean).

## System Health Score: 9 / 10

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Pipeline completeness | 10/10 | All 8 tasks deployed, recurring, logic sound |
| Timing & scheduling | 10/10 | Crons correct; Manager's 9 PM move is a net reliability gain |
| Cross-task coherence | 9/10 | Ledger clean; single-source-of-truth holding across all consumers |
| Data persistence / GitHub | 9/10 | 5/5 recent syncs succeeded; one silent-abort incident (Chef, 06-26) fully recovered |
| Notification reliability | 9/10 | Dual-channel nudges intact; ntfy queue clean |
| Rating data lifecycle | 9/10 | Steady cadence; one-cycle lag is by design |
| Prompt/design fidelity | 8/10 | Second straight cycle with drift found (now reconciled); recommend tightening this as an ongoing Manager check rather than only monthly |

Residual risk is the same class as last cycle: prompt text quietly drifting from actual behavior/schedule between Developer reviews. Nothing here is urgent — it's cosmetic until it isn't — but it's the one recurring theme worth watching.

## Next Review Date

**Friday, August 7, 2026, 6:00 AM** (first Friday of August, scheduled slot) — or sooner if Sean triggers a manual run. Priorities for that run: confirm the 8 reconciliations stuck, re-check for any new prompt/schedule drift (now a 2-for-2 pattern worth a closer look), and confirm the Kitchen_Log.md size is back under control after today's Archivist pass.
