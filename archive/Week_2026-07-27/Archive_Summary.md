Nothing is missing. There is no carryover file to archive (that mechanism was removed).

The rating form was checked for content, not just for size, before archiving and before reset: it is the full 2,538-byte submission the Critic wrote at 15:17 today from Drive doc `Rate_Submission_2026-07-27` (`19OHtQ-_Ks509w1KFqy4gYYhDoZ8DQjI3gUbtAO9pvbc`, created 2026-08-06T16:29:56Z), with all five dishes and every note intact.

## The week that was

Five dinners planned, five cooked. **Zero drops, zero carries, zero annotations** — the Kitchen Manager reconciled this week clean four nights running (08-01, 08-02, 08-03, 08-05) and declared it closed and final at five. The only calendar edit inside the week was Sean moving the Paella from Sat 08-01 to Sun 08-02 (~6:02 PM on 08-01) — a day reassignment, not a drop.

| Day | Dish | Stars | Cook again |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon 07-27 | Philly Cheesesteak Stuffed Peppers | ★★★★★ 5 | *Not specified — field left BLANK* |
| Tue 07-28 | Jamaican Jerk Chicken Thighs with Coconut Rice & Black Beans | ★★★★★ 5 | Yes |
| Wed 07-29 | Bang Bang Salmon Rice Bowls | ★★★★★ 5 | Yes |
| Thu 07-30 | Vietnamese Lemongrass Pork Meatball Bowls | ★★★★☆ 4 | Yes |
| Sun 08-02 | Spanish Shrimp & Chorizo Paella *(Sean moved it off Sat 08-01)* | ★★★★☆ 4 | Yes |

*(Mon/Tue reflect the swap Sean made on 07-27. Fri 07-31 and Sat 08-01 were free.)*

Week average **4.6★** — **the best week on record**: the first with no dish below 4★, no "Cook again: No," and no difficulty miss. Every dish came back "as-expected" on difficulty.

Ratings submitted by Sean from the King's Table dashboard **2026-08-06 10:29 AM**, ~13 hours after the Manager's default-priority nudge and one step short of the "high" rung on the escalation ladder. Processed by the Critic today at 15:20: five entries appended to `Recipe_Ratings.md` (29 → 34, eight weeks of data), `Preferences.md` auto-section rewritten, lessons file written. Full analysis in `Lessons_Learned_Week_of_2026-07-27.md` in this folder.

### Three findings worth carrying forward

1. **Shrimp is exonerated.** The Paella scored 4★ / cook again yes on a dairy-free saffron sofrito, confirming the kitchen's only 1★ (Creamy Cajun Shrimp Pasta) was a yogurt-cream-sauce failure, not a shrimp failure. Shrimp returns to the roster **as a weekend / best-eaten-fresh protein only** — Sean: *"the microwave and shrimp do not get along, they became rubbery and tough."*
2. **Two of five dishes were cooked with a defining ingredient missing** — lemongrass from the Vietnamese meatballs, chorizo from the Paella — and both scored 4 rather than a likely 5. Those two scores measure a substitution, not the recipe. Both dishes deserve a clean re-run; neither goes near the watch list.
3. **Sourcing change, stated outright by Sean in the submission:** he has *"officially moved away from Instacart as the source of truth"* and now builds a King Soopers pickup cart by hand from the shopping list. The produce-count rule survives; its Instacart framing does not.

Two standing requests recorded: the Philly cheesesteak filling **on a hoagie**, and **season the bell peppers before the pre-cook** (unseasoned peppers "dulled the Philly cheese steak flavor").

## Rating form reset ✅

`Rate_This_Week.md` was reset to the blank template after archiving.

The ordering guard added to this task on 2026-08-07 (CR-D) was checked first: **the Critic had already logged its run today at 15:20**, so the form it needed had been read and processed and the reset was safe. Had the Critic not logged, the reset would have been skipped — this task's step 3 erases the Critic's input, and on 2026-08-01 a catch-up fired both within one second of each other.

## Housekeeping — Kitchen Log trimmed ✅ (required, not optional)

`System\Kitchen_Log.md` had reached **269,772 bytes**, well over the 150 KB threshold at which the trim became mandatory (raised from the old advisory ~60 KB wording on 2026-08-07, precisely because every run judged it "not clearly needed").

Performed as a guarded, deduping operation **before** this run's log entry was written, never interleaved with it:

- **Stability check** — md5 of the live log taken twice 8 seconds apart, identical; no employee mid-write. Re-checked immediately before the rewrite. Pre-trim backup taken.
- **Dedupe check first.** The **18 entries from 2026-06-27 through 2026-07-03 were already archived** in `Kitchen_Log_2026-06-27_to_2026-07-03_archived_2026-08-01.md` and had been sitting duplicated in the live log since the 08-01 trim was reverted by a write race. A line-by-line diff confirmed the live copies were **byte-identical** to the archived ones, so they were **removed from the live log only — no second archive copy was written.**
- **New archive written** for the 7 entries not yet filed anywhere: `Kitchen_Log_Archive\Kitchen_Log_2026-07-05_to_2026-07-09_archived_2026-08-07.md` (16,113 B). Verified on disk, byte-for-byte against the source, **before** anything was removed from the live log.
- **Entry count verified: 85 headers before → 59 live + 7 newly archived + 19 removed-as-duplicates (18 real entries plus the `[TASK NAME]` template line embedded in the 06-28 entry) = 85. Zero entries lost.**
- Kept region diffed against the pre-trim backup: **byte-identical**. Newest entry still the Developer's 2026-08-07 15:52; oldest retained is the Critic's 2026-07-10 08:00. Trailing pointer line updated.
- Live log **269,772 → 207,263 bytes.**

⚠️ **The live log is still ~207 KB, above the 150 KB threshold, after a fully compliant trim.** This is not backlog — it is the most recent four weeks, and the retention rule is "~4 weeks." Cutting further would reach inside that window, so it was left alone and is flagged instead. Recent entries have grown very long (single Manager and Developer entries now run 3–5 KB each), so 4 weeks no longer fits under 150 KB. **Someone should decide whether the retention window shortens to ~3 weeks or the threshold rises — that is a policy change and belongs in a Change Request, not in an Archivist's unilateral judgment call.** Noted for the Developer's next review.
