# Archive Summary — Week of 2026-07-20 (Mon 07-20 – Sun 07-26)

**Archived by:** The Archivist
**Archived on:** 2026-08-01 ~11:30 MDT — **late catch-up run.** The scheduled slot was Friday 2026-07-31 4:30 PM; the host was offline and this fired ~19 hours late, alongside catch-up runs of the Kitchen Manager and the Critic.
**Source of truth:** `System\Current_Week.md` — PREVIOUS_WEEK `2026-07-20`, PREVIOUS_MENU_FILE `Menu_Week_of_2026-07-20.md`.

## Archived files — all present, all verified ✅

| File | Bytes | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| `Menu_Week_of_2026-07-20.md` | 4,002 | ✅ md5 matches source |
| `Shopping_List_Week_of_2026-07-20.md` | 5,108 | ✅ md5 matches source |
| `Lessons_Learned_Week_of_2026-07-20.md` | 6,608 | ✅ md5 matches source |
| `Rate_This_Week.md` | 3,446 | ✅ Fully populated — all **6 of 6** dishes rated, complete notes |

Nothing is missing. There is no carryover file to archive (that mechanism was removed).

**Answering the Kitchen Manager's open question from its 11:23 entry:** it flagged that the Critic and the Archivist fired within one second of each other instead of their designed 4.5-hour separation, and warned that *"the archived copy in `Archive\Week_2026-07-20\` may be blank or partial — verify tonight and re-file by hand if so."* **It is not blank. No hand re-filing is needed.** The archived `Rate_This_Week.md` is the full 3,446-byte submission with all six dishes and every note intact, byte-identical to what the Critic wrote and to the Drive source. The race resolved cleanly.

## The week that was

Six dinners planned, six cooked — the only six-dish week in the rotation so far, because Creamy Cajun Shrimp Pasta was carried in from 2026-07-13 and finally cooked Mon 07-20. Zero drops.

| Day | Dish | Stars |
|---|---|---|
| Mon 07-20 | Creamy Cajun Shrimp Pasta *(carried from 2026-07-13)* | ★☆☆☆☆ 1 |
| Tue 07-21 | Ginger-Sesame Turkey Lettuce Wraps | ★★★★☆ 4 |
| Wed 07-22 | Italian Sausage, White Bean & Spinach Skillet | ★★★★★ 5 |
| Thu 07-23 | Weeknight Butter Chicken | ★★★★★ 5 |
| Fri 07-24 | Lemon-Garlic Butter Scallops with Asparagus & Orzo | ★★★★☆ 4 |
| Sun 07-26 | Chimichurri Flank Steak with Charred Corn & Tomato Salad *(Sean moved it off Sat 07-25)* | ★★★★★ 5 |

Week average **4.0★**. Five of six "cook again: yes".

Ratings submitted by Sean from the King's Table dashboard **2026-07-27 11:47 AM** — Drive doc `Rate_Submission_2026-07-20` (1,780 B, id `1HkGXq8qxXoDK7DvcKBDszwyBGq0ecB7zbAwIzym7RtU`). Processed by the Critic on its catch-up run at 11:23 today: six entries appended to `Recipe_Ratings.md` (23 → 29), `Preferences.md` auto-section rewritten, lessons file written. The full Critic analysis lives in `Lessons_Learned_Week_of_2026-07-20.md` in this folder; three headline findings were a first 1★ in 29 dishes, reheat quality becoming a scoring dimension, and a first "harder than described".

## Pipeline state at time of archiving ⚠️

The host was offline from **Mon 2026-07-27 ~9:05 PM to Sat 2026-08-01 ~11:16 AM** — roughly 4.5 days — taking out four Manager nightly checks and the entire Friday 07-31 pipeline. On restart the scheduler issued catch-up fires for only **three** of the six affected tasks:

| Task | Scheduled | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Kitchen Manager (nightly) | 07-28 … 07-31 | ❌ Four checks missed; caught up 08-01 11:23, escalated to Sean |
| The Critic | Fri 07-31 12:00 PM | ✅ Caught up 08-01 11:23 — completed fully |
| The Archivist | Fri 07-31 4:30 PM | ✅ Caught up 08-01 11:23 — this run |
| **The Chef** | Fri 07-31 5:00 PM | ❌ **No catch-up fire. Next automatic run Fri 08-07.** |
| **The Scheduler** | Fri 07-31 7:30 PM | ❌ No catch-up fire |
| **The Scribe** | Fri 07-31 7:45 PM | ❌ No catch-up fire |
| GitHub host sync | Fri 07-31 8:15 PM | ❌ Skipped — "No trigger file found" |

**Consequence — the week of Mon 2026-08-03 has no plan.** No menu file, no shopping list, no recipe cards, and zero 🍽️ calendar events for 08-03 – 08-09. `Current_Week.md` still reads ACTIVE 2026-07-27 / PREVIOUS 2026-07-20, LAST_UPDATED 2026-07-24. The Manager has queued an urgent ntfy asking Sean to run **the Chef, then the Scheduler, then the Scribe**, in that order, today.

**Note on the Archivist's normal handoff:** this task's output is normally a handoff "for the Chef (5 PM)". That Chef run is not coming automatically — the handoff is void until Sean triggers it manually.

## Corrections to the record

- **Week 2026-07-13 is already archived.** The Critic's 11:23 entry lists *"week 2026-07-13 is still unarchived"* among the outage consequences. That is not right — `Archive\Week_2026-07-13\` exists and is complete (Archive_Summary, menu, shopping list, lessons, rating form), filed by the Archivist on 2026-07-24 16:40. Most likely the Critic read a stale directory listing; see below. No action needed.

## Note on file verification ⚠️ (worth reading before trusting any sandbox listing)

The sandbox mount was **badly unreliable** during this run, in two distinct ways:

1. **Stale metadata.** `ls` reported `Rate_This_Week.md` at 126 bytes and `Recipe_Ratings.md` at 4,497 bytes while live content reads returned 3,446 and 6,703. Trusting the listing would have archived an empty rating form.
2. **A stale, truncated copy of `Kitchen_Log.md`.** Early reads returned a 708-line / 170,619-byte version whose newest entry was 2026-07-27 21:04. The live file is 732 lines / 184,508 bytes and contains the Manager's and the Critic's 2026-08-01 11:23 entries. Reading the stale copy produced a confident and completely wrong interim diagnosis — that the Critic had died halfway through, having written ratings but not its lessons file. It had simply not finished yet.

Every factual claim in this summary was re-verified against live content reads (and md5 comparison for the archived copies) rather than directory metadata. **Recommendation for every task in this kitchen: never conclude a file is missing, stale, or unwritten from `ls` output or a single early read — re-read the content, and prefer a second read a few seconds apart when another employee may be running concurrently.**

## Housekeeping — Kitchen Log trimmed ✅

`System\Kitchen_Log.md` had grown to **190,574 bytes**, roughly 3× the ~60 KB threshold at which the Archivist may move entries older than ~4 weeks into `System\Kitchen_Log_Archive\`.

This was **initially deferred** partway through the run, and deliberately so: a trim is a full rewrite, and the mount was demonstrably serving stale and truncated copies of that exact file while two other employees were writing to it concurrently. "Never lose entries" outranks the size guidance.

**Re-checked at 11:33 once the Critic had finished** — mount stable (identical md5 across two passes five seconds apart), no task mid-flight — and the trim was then performed safely:

- Moved the **18 entries from 2026-06-27 through 2026-07-03** into `Kitchen_Log_Archive\Kitchen_Log_2026-06-27_to_2026-07-03_archived_2026-08-01.md` (47,208 B).
- Live log **190,574 → ~144,000 B**, retaining the most recent ~4 weeks; oldest retained entry is the Kitchen Manager's 2026-07-05 14:03.
- **Entry count verified: 69 before → 51 live + 18 archived = 69. Zero entries lost.**
- The write was guarded by an md5 re-check immediately beforehand, with a pre-trim backup taken first.

The live log remains ~2.4× the 60 KB guideline. That is recent-entry verbosity rather than backlog — trimming further would cut inside the 4-week retention window, so it was left alone.
